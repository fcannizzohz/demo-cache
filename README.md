# Demo Cache

Hazelcast is widely used as a high-performance caching layer to speed up access to data stored in one or more underlying systems.

In this series of micro-blogs, weâ€™ll explore how to use Hazelcast effectively as a cache, covering both fundamental and advanced features, including:

 - Implementing core caching patterns
 - Applying advanced caching strategies
 - Using Change Data Capture (CDC) to keep the cache in sync
 - Improving read performance with Near Cache
 - Leveraging CQRS with Near Cache for optimal separation of read/write paths
 - Enforcing strong consistency with the CP Subsystem
 - Using persistence to optimise cache startup and recovery
 - Monitoring and alerting on cache operations

Each topic will include code examples to show how these capabilities can be implemented in practice.
